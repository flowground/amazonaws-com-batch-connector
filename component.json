    "description": "AWS Batch enables you to run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud. Batch\ncomputing is a common way for developers, scientists, and engineers to access\nlarge amounts of compute resources, and AWS Batch removes the undifferentiated\nheavy lifting of configuring and managing the required infrastructure. AWS Batch\nwill be familiar to users of traditional batch computing software. This service\ncan efficiently provision resources in response to jobs submitted in order to\neliminate capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver results\nquickly.\n\nAs a fully managed service, AWS Batch enables developers, scientists, and\nengineers to run batch computing workloads of any scale. AWS Batch automatically\nprovisions compute resources and optimizes the workload distribution based on\nthe quantity and scale of the workloads. With AWS Batch, there is no need to\ninstall or manage batch computing software, which allows you to focus on\nanalyzing results and solving problems. AWS Batch reduces operational\ncomplexities, saves time, and reduces costs, which makes it easy for developers,\nscientists, and engineers to run their batch jobs in the AWS Cloud.",

You can create MANAGED or UNMANAGED \ncompute environments.\n\nIn a managed compute environment, AWS Batch manages the capacity and instance\ntypes of the compute resources within the environment. This is based on the\ncompute resource specification that you define or the launch template\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html] \nthat you specify when you create the compute environment. You can choose to use\nAmazon EC2 On-Demand Instances or Spot Instances in your managed compute\nenvironment. You can optionally set a maximum price so that Spot Instances only\nlaunch when the Spot Instance price is below a specified percentage of the\nOn-Demand price.\n\nMulti-node parallel jobs are not supported on Spot Instances.\n\nIn an unmanaged compute environment, you can manage your own compute resources.\nThis provides more compute resource configuration options, such as using a\ncustom AMI, but you must ensure that your AMI meets the Amazon ECS container\ninstance AMI specification. For more information, see Container Instance AMIs\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container_instance_AMIs.html] \nin the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. After you have created\nyour unmanaged compute environment, you can use the DescribeComputeEnvironments \noperation to find the Amazon ECS cluster that is associated with it. Then,\nmanually launch your container instances into that Amazon ECS cluster. For more\ninformation, see Launching an Amazon ECS Container Instance\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_container_instance.html] \nin the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.\n\nAWS Batch does not upgrade the AMIs in a compute environment after it is created\n(for example, when a newer version of the Amazon ECS-optimized AMI is\navailable). You are responsible for the management of the guest operating system\n(including updates and security patches) and any additional application software\nor utilities that you install on the compute resources. To use a new AMI for\nyour AWS Batch jobs:\n\n 1.  Create a new compute environment with the new AMI.\n    \n    \n 2.  Add the compute environment to an existing job queue.\n    \n    \n 3.  Remove the old compute environment from your job queue.\n    \n    \n 4.  Delete the old compute environment.",
